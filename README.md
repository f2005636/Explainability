# Explainability

*Pre-Approval Model – AI Explainability*
The objective of this exercise is to develop a deep learning model (Multi-layer Perceptron) to predict the probability of a customer to default on the loan. The pre-approved loan means that the lender has already evaluated the financial standing and credit history of the applicant. Hence the processing time for the loan is short and the disbursal is quick.

*Balance Consolidataion – Machine Learning Explainability*
The objective of this exercise is to develop a machine learning model (XG Boost) to predict the probability of a customer to opt for balance consolidation. Balance consolidation is the act of combining high interest loans into a single low interest loan.
